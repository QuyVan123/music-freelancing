The first version I created of this, is contained in the directory "before_oop". 
It reached a point where it was too messy and the more changes I created, the more issues came about

This version attempts to use oop methedology. There is still a lot of code that needs refactoring, but my main goal is to create a working prototype.

SETUP
------
1) Move files into the appropriate web directory
2) Edit the config file called config.php" 
3) In the folder "run_once" run the file "first_config". This page is used to setup database and tables as needed.

Should be working!
