**The first version** I created of this, is contained in the directory "before_oop". 
It was a hack job. 

**The second version** uses OOP methodology. I started understanding a lot more about designing websites and thought that I had a fair amount of experience. It was about time I moved on to using a framework.

**The third version** uses the Laravel framework. Currently learning Laravel right now!
